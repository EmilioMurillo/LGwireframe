# LGwireframe

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Here I was given already desinged wireframes. I was able to build with HTML and CSS from scratch the given designs.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time actually putting together a wireframe for a client. When I created this one I recetley unlocked what I belive every web developer should have unlocked. Which is not to set a fixed height to your sections when buidling the very bausc wireframe of the wireframe. Folowed by the box hack and its beautful magic. After that, I just placed all the content in followed by some padding to make it look good. Doing this wireframe for the first time really set me up for success in future projects because it acts as a template for me.
